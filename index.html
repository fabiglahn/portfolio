          <p>
            I have been working as a Digital Fashion Marketing Specialist for
            over 10 years and now it is time to add an important aspect of
            digitalization to my portfolio: Web Development. For a long time,
            the classic areas of the fashion industry have slept through
            digitalization and even today there are many boards that never seem
            to have really arrived in the year 2021. Here, not only the topic of
            social media marketing is of great relevance, especially responsive
            online stores, the use of data and digital touchpoints may no longer
            be treated as side projects. But when I'm not in the digital world
            (on Instagram & Co.), I mainly like to do fitness outside, go
            surfing in Spain or hiking in Bavaria. Otherwise, I sometimes spend
            4 hours at the stove for a particularly good dinner.
